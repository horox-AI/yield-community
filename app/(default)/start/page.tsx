                          SaaS adoption is snowballing. A recent Harvey Nash survey revealed that SaaS was voted the most important technology in helping
                          achieve business goals.

                          Products within the SaaS industry serve an immense number of functions. While some are intended to cater to the specific needs of a

                        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-slate-200">Scope of Industries and Market Size</h3>
                        <p>
                          The vertical SaaS business model is an end-to-end solution designed for the needs of a specific sector. These solutions' software
                          features are specially designed to streamline particular industry operations. On the other hand, horizontal SaaS solutions are less
                          industry-personalized and more problem-oriented. Their increased applicability across several industries sets them apart from
                          horizontal SaaS.

                        <p>
                          In the vertical SaaS model, acquiring customers takes less time and effort than in horizontal SaaS. As you can imagine, if only a
                          few businesses offer solutions to a niche problem, customers will likely choose a business and stick with it. Make sure you have a
